This is the OpenCL Research project.

It is called cgmtest to denote it is a test environment comparing the
efficiencies of OpenCL against the original sequential version of the
course grain matcher (cgm).

In this directory, you will find:

./tester - runs the comprehensive testing harness
*.c - Host programs to organize the OpenCL kernels
*.cl - Kernel code

INSTALLATION
==================
To run this testing harness, first ensure you have the latest version
of ATI Stream (at least v2.1). You can download it from:

http://developer.amd.com/gpu/ATIStreamSDK/Pages/default.aspx

Once this is installed, set your environment as follows:

PATH should include gcc
ATISTREAM should include the root directory of ATI Stream:
	/path/to/ati-stream-v2.1
LDFLAGS=-L${ATISTREAM}/usr/lib/x86_64
CPPFLAGS=-I${ATISTREAM}/usr/include
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ATISTREAM}/usr/lib/x86_64
LD_PRELOAD=${ATISTREAM}/usr/lib/x86_64/libatiocl64.so

USAGE
==================
After the paths are set correctly, you can run the entire suite of tests
with one command:

./tester

This runs all OpenCL implemenations (besides image memory optimization)
using various key lengths, list sizes, and averages the time for
a more accurate measurement. Note that the times dispalyed are measurements of
the kernel execution and the enqueueing of the kernel and its arguments
for execution. The buffer initialization and writing is not included.

If you would like to run tests separately, you can use them as follows:

./cgmtest - Sequential, OpenCL Simple "Linear" Parallel, OpenCL Binary Search
./cgmtest MAXVALUE KEYSIZE LISTSIZE REPS MAXCOMPUTEUNITS [GPU_TOGGLE]

./cgmtest_image - Image Memory Optimization
cgmtest_image MAXVALUE KEYSIZE LISTSIZE REPS MAXCOMPUTEUNITS [GPU_TOGGLE]

./cgmtest_cached - Constant Caching, Local Caching
cgmtest_cached MAXVALUE KEYSIZE LISTSIZE REPS MAXCOMPUTEUNITS [GPU_TOGGLE]

For all programs, a GPU_TOGGLE of 1 sets the kernel to use GPU devices.
